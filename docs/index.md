My course features a mix of tutorials to prepare beforehand, and live-streamed lectures and interactive computer labs. This material will get you started in

- managing data- and computation-intensive projects efficiently, and
- using web scraping (i.e., the automatic extraction of information from publicly accessible websites) and Application Protocol Interfaces (APIs, i.e., a more structured way to obtain data from online sources) for your own data science projects.

I have set up this site so that you can optimally prepare for the sessions. The site
is work-in-progress, and will be updated once we get closer to the actual date.

## What's next

- Check out the syllabus and how to prepare for each session (&rarr; [syllabus](syllabus.md))
- Carefully go through the setup procedure for your computer, and verify that `R`, `python`, and `make` are callable from the command line/terminal (&rarr; [setup guide](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup))
<!--- Review the detailed course schedule (&rarr; [schedule](schedule.md))-->
- Read a bit about your instructors (&rarr; [about the instructors](about.md))
