## Session 3: Customer Lifetime Value [(George Knox)](about.md#george-knox)

### Learning Objectives

- Understand how to calculate customer lifetime value in different settings:
	- when customer churn/dropout is observed, e.g., subscription models
	- when it is unobserved, e.g., transactional relationships e.g., grocery shopping

- Understanding how differences across customers, i.e., heterogeneity, affects retention and lifetime value.
