### Preparation

<!--!!! warning
    Likely to be updated soon.-->

- Watch an [introduction video to web scraping and APIs](https://tiu.nu/scraping-video) (~20 minutes): what are they, what can they be used for?

-	Think about which online data may be useful for your own research; be able to show the website, database or API to everyone in class.

- Set up your own laptop for in-class exercises
    - On top of the software stack for your [session on workflows](workflows.md), you need to install the "web scraping tools"
    - Details are available on [https://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup/webscraping](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/setup/webscraping).
    - Please verify you have properly installed these tools by typing `chromedriver` on your terminal/Anaconda prompt.

- Browse my article on [how Spotify has changed music consumption](https://tiu.nu/spotify). Pay close attention to the data section.

- Go through the web scraping tutorial, which is a Jupyter Notebook ([preview as HTML](webscraper_socialblade.html), [download as .ipynb](webscraper_socialblade.ipynb)) that illustrates the basic steps of web scraping.
