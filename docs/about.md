# About the instructors

## Hannes Datta

**Hi, I'm Hannes Datta, an Associate Professor of Marketing at Tilburg University.**

I develop advanced econometric models that guide managerial decision-making and inform public policy in the area of digital media consumption (e.g., on streaming services, on digital TV), branding, and retailing.

Next to my [research](https://tiu.nu/datta), I have a passion for teaching, and have won several teaching awards in the past years (among others, Tilburg University's Teacher of the Year Award).

For my research, I make use of web scraping and API technology, and that's also how the
inaugural (2019) version of this course was born. Recently, I have launched an initiative to enhance research productivity by designing efficient workflows to manage data- and computation-intensive projects. That's also why I use this [new site and brand-new tutorials](http://tilburgsciencehub.com) throughout this course. The site is open-source, by the way, so feel free to contribute to it!

You can best reach me (for short questions) via WhatsApp, on +31134668938. More formal inquiries should be [emailed](mailto:h.datta@tilburguniversity.edu).
